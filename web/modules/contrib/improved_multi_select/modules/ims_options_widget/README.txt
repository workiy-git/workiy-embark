INTRODUCTION
------------

The IMS (Improved Multi Select) Options Widget module extends
the options_select widget. It just keeps existing items of a field
at the top of available items in order to keep items ordered
in case if you have the Allow re-ordering of selected items option enabled.

Note: this widget doesn't support optgroups. It flattens values of
a field.


REQUIREMENTS
------------

No special requirements for this module.


INSTALLATION
------------

* Install as usual.


CONFIGURATION
-------------

* Navigate to the Manage form display for a field and change widget type to
the IMS select list.
