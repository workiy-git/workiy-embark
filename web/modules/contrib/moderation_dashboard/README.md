### Overview

Moderation Dashboard provides a per-user dashboard that contains useful blocks related to managing moderated content.

This module is meant as a jumping-off point for administrators to customize the dashboard to fit their content editor's needs. As a result, no update hooks will be provided between releases as users are expected to change the module's default configuration.

Since the dashboard is built entirely with Page Manager and Views, everything you see can be configured via the UI! Feel free to go crazy.

For the chart.js feature, follow either of the options:
1. Download chart.js library using composer or manually from https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js/releases/tag/v3.9.1 placing inside libraries/chartjs/ (Downloading via composer is recommended.)
2. Use the CDN option.

**How to download chart.js library using composer:**
1. Add following code inside `repositories` section in your project's `composer.json`
```
"chart.js": {
    "type": "package",
    "package": {
        "name": "nnnick/chartjs",
        "version": "v3.9.1",
        "type": "drupal-library",
        "dist": {
            "url": "https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js/releases/download/v3.9.1/chart.js-3.9.1.tgz",
            "type": "tar"
        }
    }
}
```
2. If not added already, please add following code under `installer-paths` in `composer.json` (Add `web` or `docroot` according to your structure)
```
"web/libraries/{$name}": [
   "type:drupal-library",
]
```
3. Then run the command `composer require nnnick/chartjs`.
4. It should automatically download and place the `chartjs` library inside `web/libraries` or `docroot/libraries` folder.

For security, it's always safer to have a local copy vs external resource.

### Customization

#### 1.x Branch
To customize the dashboard, all you need to do is enable the Views UI and Page Manager UI modules!

For convenience, you can go straight to the Page Manager configuration page at /admin/structure/page_manager/manage/moderation_dashboard/page_variant__moderation_dashboard-panels_variant-0__content

Page Manager is a power-house, and will let you add, remove, configure, and re-order any block normally available in Drupal. Additionally, you can add different Page Variants to the Dashboard and configure their Selection Criteria so that different roles see different dashboards. Go wild!

#### 2.x Branch
To customize the dashboard, all you need to do is enable the Views UI!

For convenience, you can go straight to the User Account Display configuration page at /admin/config/people/accounts/display/moderation_dashboard
Here you can edit the layout via Layout Builder.
